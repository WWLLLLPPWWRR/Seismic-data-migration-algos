Seismic depth migration is a geophysical imaging process that transforms seismic reflection data from recorded time into true subsurface depth, correcting for wave travel paths and velocity variations to produce an accurate structural image of the Earth.

Seismic migration via Kondrashkov's Elliptical Reflection Decomposition (ERD) method is impemented in Jupyter Notebook.

Wavefield modeling is provided via special geophysical software:
